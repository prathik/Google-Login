Google-Login
============

Login into your Wordpress Blog using Google credentials. This project uses LightOpenId (http://gitorious.org/lightopenid).

As soon as a visitor enters your website, they will be redirected to the authentication page, and after they authenticate they will be logged into your website.

Usecase
-------

* Very useful if you run a company intranet using Wordpress and the company has a Google Apps enterprise account.

* Your school has a Google Apps account and you want to run a student blog using Wordpress where login is essential.

* You run a Wordpress community using Buddypress and you want all new users to be registered members.

History
-------

This plugin was created to allow users of a company intranet to login with their Google Apps credentials. As soon as one gets to the Wordpress website, they are redirected to the prompt page, and if they provide the credentials and the permissions, they are logged in.

Known Bugs
----------

Users are redirected to authentication page as soon as they visit the page. This is not a bug, but an intended feature. An option to disablle this will be added in the next release.
